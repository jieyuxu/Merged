To play, place tiles on the board in empty slots. 

To place a tile, type the row number and column number of the slot in which you wish to place the tile, separated by a space. 
When placing a two-tile piece, the coordinates entered should be those of the slot where the tile with an asterisk next to it will go.

To rotate a tile, type ‘r’. Tiles are always rotated counterclockwise. 

When the board contains three or more tiles with the same value, those tiles will merge into a single tile of the next highest value. 
For example, three ones merge to create a two, and so on.

The more tiles you successfully place on the board, the higher your score. The game ends when the board fills up.

To quit the game without saving your score, press ctrl-C.
